SPECIFICATION

Short description: As the name suggests, I am here delivering a login page test automation of a popular buy-and-sell platform from Serbia.
Selenium WebDriver is my preferable tool in this project.
Link to the login page that's being tested: https://www.limundo.com/Prijava

The following automation tests are included:

- Before the testing process begings, set up default configuration
- Assert login page URL
- Assert login page title
- Assert login page logo
- Assert valid login (or invalid login; depends on your values)
- Assert logout after valid login
- Assert 'password forgotten' link with false email
- Assert 'password forgotten' link with valid email
